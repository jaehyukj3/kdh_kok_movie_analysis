The animation looked good, and there were several cinematic, eye-popping moments that surpassed what is typically expected from a cartoon. The directing was wonderful, and I could clearly tell Seong-Ho Jang was passionate about what he was putting on screen.",4/5.0

It's beautifully animated and stays true to the bible throughout the story - which is very important to us. We found the Angel platform had lots of great programming available.

Audience,,"Jul 24, 2025","There is a brand-new film released recently on Angel.com. It’s called The King of Kings and it’s a cartoon based animated film touching on the teachings and life of Jesus. I personally watched it via my Fire Cube device and the streaming was incredible. This film was in 4K quality and wasn’t blurry and it was very clear the entire time. And for this being a Christian based production I was pleasing surprised that it was so high quality and looked amazing. The film wasn’t cheesy or anything in that regards. I really enjoyed the message behind the film and how it was a strong introduction to the life of Christ. 


The film begins with Charles Dickson is reciting his story of the Scrooge to an audience. When his son, Walter and his cat stop the production of the play while trying to perform a reenacted of King Arthur. Instead of punishing him, he takes a different route thanks to his wife and tells him the story of Jesus. He begins with the birth of Jesus, discussed his miracles, his betrayal and resurrection. The film is very PG rated and the only violence kids will see is mark-lines on Jesus from the after effects of Jesus being beaten. Kids can’t really see the punishment that Jesus took its sort of censored in a way. Later they can see the nails marks near his hands but even that is a clean version. I liked how they didn’t make it too violent for kids where everyone wouldn’t have to worry about what is being seen. They will get to watch the scenes unfold of Jesus entire life it covered all the big events and miracles. My favorite one was probably the one of the women and go and sin no more. This was done in a way kids could understand without making it too adult. 


The film voiced high paying actors and actresses throughout the film. These included Kenneth Branagh (Thor and 2015 Cinderella), Mark Hamill (Star Wars – Luke Skywalker), Pierce Brosnan (James Bond), Forest Whitaker (Star Wars Rogue), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars, X-men Apocalypse, The Addam’s Family, and The Nativity Story), James Arnold Taylor (Best known in Star Wars Clone Wars voicing Obi-Wan Kenobi). There were tons of voicing that people will recognize from the Star Wars films. Two of my favorites were in this movie. I have always enjoyed Mark Hamill and Oscar Isaac in his roles. I think having the powerhouse lineup will help lure kids into the story of Jesus. They are also estimated that this film has outdone other cartoon films. It has surpassed the popular 1998’s Prince of Egypt. It raised over $19 million just in the opening weekend. This film will go down as another popular film that will be rewatched again and again.",5/5.0

Audience,,"Jun 16, 2025","I very much enjoyed this and it's an accurate telling. Appropriate for adults and children, whether they're believers or not. It's a gentle introduction to the story of Christ and it hits all the major milestones. So good we saw it twice.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Jun 15, 2025",This is beyond imagination,5/5.0
Audience,,"Jun 13, 2025","The King of Kings is kind of like Passion of the Christ for kids. That's something I have been hearing from others as well. It's got just enough action to keep kids of all ages interested, but it also has that deep, powerful message of Jesus to keep adults engaged. It can appeal to everyone.

The animation is pretty good for an Angel Studios movie. They keep getting better and better. The casting is out of sight, with the likes of people like Pierce Brosnan, Oscar Isaac and Jim Cummings. It's hard to believe all these big names signed on, makes me wonder how that process went and how it actually happened. I know there are obvious conflicts of beliefs going on there, but I know it's happened the other way around plenty of times, with Christians doing big Hollywood blockbusters. This reminds me of the excellent Christian kids movie that came out a while back called The Star. a loaded cast can make a big difference.

The unique twist here is that the story is told through Charles Dickens as he reads the story to his little boy. So, the movie tends to jump back and forth between the Dickens family and  the life of Jesus. Sometimes, they even blend together, which is interesting. The concept works quite well and introduces a little more entertainment value in the form of kids and  funny pet cat.

Overall, The King of Kings is an excellent animated Christian film that does what it needs to get the timeless message across to both kids and adults alike.",4/5.0
Audience,,"Jun 10, 2025","Great movie for everyone, especially for kids, lukewarm believers and nonbelievers alike.  It will certainly peak your curiosity about the King of Kings, Lord of Lords and Master of the Universe.

Audience,genna.short,"Jun 8, 2025",Beautifully animated and charming. Biblically accurate to the life of Christ.,5/5.0
Audience,,"Jun 8, 2025","I wasn't expecting much from this, especially considering the actors who took part in it. Good thing too, because I was very disappointed. No wonder it received high criticism from hollyweird. It was nothing like the Bible, a bunch of interpretations of an easy life, whereas Jesus was constantly challenged and degraded by the masses. This makes His life look like a cakewalk. It was nothing of the sort! If you don't know the Bible, you would probably enjoy some of it, but for those who do, you may as well skip it.   If you are trying to introduce yourself or your family to God, I guess it's better than nothing  but almost every story has been altered.  So you may as well follow the Commandments, teaching the true Word.",0.5/5.0
Audience,,"Jun 6, 2025","The King Of Kings from this year is a remarkable, beautiful tale about Jesus told from the character of Charles Dickens. The animation at times looks real like the water and such and the film is a true reminder of our only hope, Jesus. I was disappointed to not see the disciples react to The Resurrection but the film still showed Jesus after being Ressurected. It is a truly inspiring film. 4 and a half out of 5.",4.5/5.0
Audience,,"Jun 6, 2025",Buena película para pasarla bien en familia,4.5/5.0
Audience,,"Jun 6, 2025","I was pleasantly surprised that this stuck to the Biblical account that most are familiar with. I found that the way it is presented makes it grab the attention of younger audiences. For Christians whose kids have been exposed to this story, there's nothing here that isn't in every other animated telling of Jesus' story, but I wish it'd been around when my kids were younger. 

For parents that like this, also highly recommend the ""Superbook"" series (the recent series rather than the 1970s-80s version).",5/5.0

Audience,,"Jun 3, 2025","What is wrong with this picture,  well Christ is not white neither was his people! Just like the Egyptian etc. This is a cartoon of lies and racial Idolatry to the fullest. Every church I've been a part of tells me That Christ's color doesn't matter but they keep painting him Caucasian when the bible clearly says he was very very dark skinned.  This mess should be deleted.  When the real Christ returns and sees all the trash everyone responsible is going to pay the client

Audience,,"May 28, 2025","Actually surprisingly good.

The animation quality is top notch and the style feels unique especially with some background art style.  The story telling element is pretty formulaic and all the stories are familiar to virtually all Christians and those who attended Sunday school.

Did I fall asleep a couple times?  Yes.  Would I recommend this to Christian families who would like to familiarize their kids to stories of Jesus without laborously reading the Bible together?   Also yes.",4/5.0

Audience,,"May 27, 2025","I personally don't like to touch on religious movies, but I did go to see this one in the theater, so . . . anyway, I really enjoyed the parts in ancient times, with Jesus, but Walter, Charles, and the cat were an annoying distraction throughout the movie. Oscar Isaac's voice work was excellent. SO GOOD. This one really didn't do much for me. I wouldn't recommend this one for a bible story. Okay.",2.5/5.0
Audience,,"May 25, 2025","Just for TV or Amazon free watch material. I felt deceived as to the movie's quality & writing team. On reading the credits it turns out that the screen team & producers were largely Asian & NOT THE ERWIN BROS SKILL & TALENT. It seems they were presented the deal & put their name on the production credits?

It felt very musty religious, as in Catholic bent. And so as a result, it lacked biblical accuracy. It's really needed Messianic Rabbi/Pastoral advise. 

I really expected more & am disappointed. So, I can't recommend the movie even for kids. Although, the truth that Jesus is King of Kings is presented. It's religiosity might confuse the younger audience & new believers.",3/5.0

Audience,,"May 15, 2025","This animated film's visual symbolism challenges Christians’ critiques that it does not explicitly show Jesus as God. It does. Jesus' transition into Walter’s father signifies that He and the Father are one.

It was a heart-melting animation, and I will never forget the scene where Christ pushed Walter out of the water. Jesus saves people from death through faith in Him—and that means believing in what the entire Bible says.",5/5.0
Audience,James K,"May 15, 2025","The first minute of the move is a great but of context setting, and is fantastically done, introducing us to Charles Dickens, the storyteller for the rest of the film. 

The next nine minutes though, were extremely painful to watch. Dickens is shown as having adopted the ""gentle parenting"" technique popular today. Apart from not being a parenting technique that Dickens would have used, it results in egocentric children. And yet this parenting is presented positively.

Once the story became about Jesus, it went much better. There are some stylistic and theological things that I don't love, but the poor parenting at the beginning means I'll never watch this with my kids.",3/5.0

Audience,Laura C,"May 5, 2025",There were several inadequacies in the narrative. Walter's character in the beginning was disrespectful toward his parents and the father was too inconsistent.

Audience,Jessica B.,"May 2, 2025",This was one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  It was a creative way of making the audience feel they were also invited in to the Christ's invitation of salvation as the child gained his understanding of what Jesus no longer being on the cross and His empty tomb all meant. It was a beautiful and moving christian family film.,5/5.0
Audience,Kim L,"May 2, 2025","Beautiful message of Jesus, the son of God and well done for children. The animation is gorgeous and I wouldn't change a thing.

Audience,,"May 1, 2025","I really loved The King of Kings! It feels like watching a bedtime story with the honest heart of Jesus’ sacrifice at its core. Jang Seongho and Oscar Isaac's portrayal is warm and genuine, showing Jesus as both gentle and quietly strong, and the animation is so vivid you almost believe the miracles are happening right before your eyes. The music pulls you in, making the big moments soar and the sad ones hit right in the chest. It’s a touching, uplifting film that reminds you what love, and faith are all about.",5/5.0
Audience,,"May 1, 2025","2 of us went to see the show and both of us loved it— wished it was longer. Such a precious love story of how Jesus would die for men, so that we could have a close relationship with God. 
The way the story was told was mostly lighthearted and often seen through a child’s eyes at times, without glossing over the sacrifice made. The animation was beautiful and worth seeing too.",5/5.0

Audience,Tony,"Apr 30, 2025","The King of Kings is not just a film — it is a reverent, awe-inspiring experience that stirs the soul and elevates the spirit. From the first frame to the final scene, this cinematic retelling of the life of Jesus Christ is nothing short of breathtaking in its depth, beauty, and conviction.

The direction is profoundly respectful and filled with purpose, treating every scene with a sense of divine gravity. The performances are nothing less than remarkable — powerful without being theatrical, tender without ever losing strength. The portrayal of Jesus is radiant, conveying both the quiet humility of a servant and the commanding authority of the Son of God.

Visually, the film is stunning. Whether depicting the miracles, the parables, or the Passion itself, every shot is composed with an artists eye and a disciples heart. The score only enhances the emotional resonance, lifting moments of glory and carrying the viewer through scenes of heartbreak with grace and dignity.

What truly sets The King of Kings apart is its unwavering commitment to the message of hope, redemption, and love at the center of Christs story. It isnt just a film for Christians — its a deeply human story that speaks to the broken, the searching, and the faithful alike.

Watching The King of Kings is more than watching a film — its stepping into sacred history, portrayed with reverence, passion, and faith. An absolute must-watch for anyone seeking inspiration, beauty, or a powerful reminder of the greatest story ever told.",5/5.0

Audience,,"Apr 28, 2025","Worst Angel Studios movie I've ever seen in existence. They usually have better movies and this one however was simply not it. The animation is terrible and as the story itself is being told, it feels like that there's stuff missing from the story within. It feels very disjointed, choppy, and overly produced. What bothers me the most is that it's tries way too hard to being two different movies and it's almost like that it doesn't know what kinda movie it wants to be. I don't know why the wife and children weren't at home while their father is at a play performing for thousands of people who already bought their tickets. It's a theater, not a daycare center. Yeah, that didn't make any sense to me and on top of that, the father rewards his child's disruptive behavior. No apologies were made towards the father and son which is seriously disheartening. People make mistakes but it is never to late to rebuild and start again. This movie was supposed to be about love and forgiveness, and I'm just not getting any of that from this horribly animated movie. The animator in the animation department seriously needs to be fired because there was no heart or effort placed into it. Angel Studios, do better. VeggieTales Easter is way better than The King of The Kings. VeggieTales is heartwarming, heartfelt, hilarious, and entertaining enough to watch. At least, VeggieTales has sing alongs and hilarious musical numbers. Some good, some bad but still fun. It made me appreciate VeggieTales a whole lot more than The King of Kings. Sorry, not sorry!",1/5.0

Audience,,"Apr 28, 2025","Good retelling of Jesus' life summing up the gospels. My 8 and 6 yr olds were able to follow the story and weren't confused by Charles Dickens and his son Walter Dickens. I found them (and the cat) distracting in the scenes, but besides being mildly annoyed, I appreciated the film as a whole. Even my 3 yr old was engaged the whole way through and could recognize scenes like the birth of Jesus as familiar stories he has heard. He was a bit scared at certain points but overall it wasn't an issue . I support more movies telling stories from the Bible and this one was worth a watch.",3.5/5.0

Audience,Luis P,"Apr 26, 2025",Loved it! Wonderfully animated and great voice casting bring the greatest story ever told to life. I think kids will enjoy and understandthe word and message. I think it also sums it up for adults who aren't familiar with the story. Highly recommended!,5/5.0
Audience,Yvonne G,"Apr 26, 2025","Amazing, this movie can help fill in any gaps you or your kid has in the how and why Jesus came to earth and had to die. Please dont miss it.",5/5.0
Audience,Sillyred,"Apr 26, 2025","This movie was hyped by what Im guessing is an older generation of believers who happen to be on tik tok. I personally felt no connection and everything flew over my 2 daughters heads because it was not deep enough. It was very superficial. The very beginning made me feel like it was a Christmas movie. A Christmas movie during Easter Passover. It also was about Charles Dickens being this amazing story teller that transported his audience to imagine what the story was about. The first 20 minutes could have been erased and replaced with more depth. It briefly discussed the Passover, which I thought would have been an essential part to focus on. It briefly showed how the Pharisees turned everyone against Jesus and had him tortured brutally. Im not asking for Passion of the Christ, but a scratch on the cheek will get you a reaction of oh that wasnt so bad. I saw and heard no emotion or reaction from any audience member. Waste of money. Movies are expensive. Dont waste yours.",1/5.0
Audience,,"Apr 26, 2025","Loved the whole movie to the point I cried the whole time lol. I would watch this movie over and over again if I were to fall so deep into temptation or how much God loves me. 
Loved this movie so much! :)


But if you didn't enjoy the movie to its best, then I (and I means, me personally) believe you put hope into thinking it would come out differently or you would see another story of Jesus Christ.

Knowing the story of Jesus Christ, yes is the same; but what would change? Why change it for, when it's for us people to see the things He did for us?

I loved this movie from the very beginning, crying the whole time. As a 16 year old, yes I struggle with so much but to see that Jesus took those struggles away and gave me a better life is so much more then I could ever ask. So why be a bit disappointed in the movie, storyline, animation, or even the way it's originally outlined? 

There is a God, and a God who doesn't want any much more then to give you the unconditional love nobody can ever give back. That's the God I love and serve as a young 16 year old girl.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Apr 26, 2025",This was a great children's movie depicting Christ. Though it covered his birth and life the hardest part of the story to tell is cruelty of the events leading to the crucifixion. This heinous act is the story of Christ and it had to be included. It was watered down for the younger audiences but was still impactful enough even for adults to get a taste of the pain Christ suffered for us. This is a must see. I will be purchasing this and it will be one of my 3 daughters favorite animated films of all time right beside the Prince of Egypt.,5/5.0
Audience,,"Apr 26, 2025","Beautifully made cartoon. So very touching, especially for the kids. As usual, like in many other of our favourite children's movies, the rotten tomato elite critics who hyjack the percentage star value have no clue!",5/5.0

Audience,Christopher S,"Apr 25, 2025","Bland, sterile, generally unmoving. Kids were climbing the seats midway through the film. This adaption of Jesus lacks focus, is overly sanitized to prevent scandal (very un-Jesus-like), and feels like a gold-embossed Hallmark Jesus. Little more than a high-budget Vacation Bible School skit. Message: Just Believe, and youll get your eternal rewards card punched on the way out.",2/5.0

Audience,,"Apr 25, 2025",The best movie I have ever seen in my life,5/5.0
Audience,Matthew R,"Apr 25, 2025","This movie is amazing in many ways, it tells the story of Jesus, but in a fresh new way, it is paced very well, so you don’t loose interest And Walter, the kid is not annoying like I thought he’d be. Some stand outs to me are Oscar Isaac (Jesus), Forrest Whitaker (Peter), and Roman Griffin Davis (Walter). Overall, a must see.",4.5/5.0
Audience,,"Apr 25, 2025",An excellent way to introduce darker and more adult aspects of the life of Jesus to young children. It deeply impacted our seven year old in ways that listening to sermons at our church had not done thus far.,3.5/5.0

Audience,,"Apr 24, 2025","We loved it! It gave us a different perspective, as we were going through Jesus's journey through the lens of a child. Seeing His story through the eyes of a child was so pure and sincere. Really reminded us of how much love our heavenly Father has for each one of us. 
It was cute, well told, and had great animation.",5/5.0

Audience,,"Apr 24, 2025","I thought this movie was so well done, and the scenes of Jesus carrying out the miracles was very moving. Not cheesy at all. I'm really impressed with Angel studios. It's nice to be able to share these meaning stories with my son, and pass it along to the next generation. The animation is also well executed and the stylized characters are fun to watch.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Apr 24, 2025",Movie was not overly religious bound but the idea to create an animated story was right on target with subject matter. It is a film for all ages. A little girl changed her seat next to me to share popcorn with her dad but in the time it took her to move seats she did not take her eyes off the screen even as she grabbed his popcorn.,4/5.0

Audience,JP Hernndez,"Apr 24, 2025",Great movie for all ages,5/5.0
Audience,Richard L,"Apr 24, 2025","Great for the family and to be watched as a family.  In general, the story was scripturally sound as the Holy Bible describes the life of Jesus Christ.  The basic plot and theme were not over-sensationalized but brought the main points of Christ's miracles, personality, divine and true deity, even his human attributes down to an earthen level.   Yet, in the end of this movie, one could only conclude that Jesus Christ is The King of Kings.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Apr 24, 2025","A beautiful telling of Jesus's life. Even toned down for younger kids, it still relays the message loud and clear. So much so that even adults can be memorized by it. It moved me to tears.",5/5.0
Audience,Connie B,"Apr 24, 2025","Awesome way to relay the story of Jesus! I want to own a copy. It's a must see for children, for everyone really. Even my husband was touched!",5/5.0

Audience,Virginia,"Apr 23, 2025",Quality of the movie,5/5.0
Audience,Winsome C,"Apr 23, 2025","This is a great movie for kids. My eleven-year-old granddaughter liked it very much. It follows the biblical story fairly closely, except, of course, for the storyteller and his family. But having the family involved helped explain the story.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Apr 23, 2025","My wife and I took our 8 and 10 year old daughters to see this movie.  The fact that it was told through the eyes of a little boy was powerful.  To see how he reacted in hearing the story for the first time. I think too many of us allow either familiarity with the story or our personal beliefs to get in the way of the message and what actually occurred and why.  This was a chance to see it from a fresh perspective that touched not only my daughters but also my wife and myself.  The animation was Disney-quality, which is not normally seen from a smaller studio.  

My recommendation: go see it with no preconceived ideas and try to see it as if hearing it for the first time.  Do not get caught up in mandating complete biblical accuracy, as there are always things which do not line up 100%, but the story overall and 90% of the details follow the biblical narrative.",5/5.0
Audience,Deborah,"Apr 23, 2025","Simple to understand movie telling the story of Jesus life, death and resurrection.",5/5.0
