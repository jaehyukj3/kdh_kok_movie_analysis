Top Critic,Alonso Duralde,"Aug 26, 2025","Probably the year‚Äôs funniest animated feature, from the interactions between the three distinct personalities of our heroines to the portrayal of over-the-top fandom.",Fresh
Top Critic,Bill Goodykoontz,"Aug 25, 2025","Not everything will make perfect sense. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs supposed to. It isn‚Äôt the kind of movie where you nitpick the details. It‚Äôs the kind of movie where you float along from one scene to the next, buoyed by catchy hits.",Fresh
Top Critic,Radheyan Simonpillai,"Aug 23, 2025","Trends collide together in this glittery cornucopia of a movie that hits all these sensations at once. This is a movie where every battle scene is presented like a music video. And that‚Äôs really fun, and catchy.",Fresh
Top Critic,Mark Kermode,"Aug 18, 2025",It's weirdly good fun.,Fresh
Top Critic,Frank Scheck,"Aug 5, 2025","KPop Demon Hunters delivers not only a cornucopia of earworms whose melodies will be lingering in your brain for weeks, but also a fast and funny genre mash-up that puts most theatrical animated releases to shame.",Fresh
Top Critic,Brian Tallerico,"Jul 28, 2025",It is emotionally empowering in ways that have made it a cross-demo hit.,Fresh
Top Critic,Wilson Chapman,"Jul 11, 2025","In the hands of directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, it‚Äôs a endearing, beautifully animated crowdpleaser, with a dorkily sincere love for the pop culture phenomena it embeds itself in.",Fresh
Top Critic,Meagan Navarro,"Jul 10, 2025",It‚Äôs easy to see why KPop Demon Hunters is fast becoming a global sensation; it‚Äôs catchy as hell. It‚Äôs nearly impossible not to get swept up in its infectious rhythm.,Fresh
Top Critic,Nell Minow,"Jul 10, 2025","‚ÄúKPop Demon Hunters‚Äù is an unexpectedly entertaining mash-up of two seemingly unrelated genres. It works because it is colorful, funny, imaginative, and above all heartfelt and sincere.",Fresh
Top Critic,Peter Debruge,"Jun 23, 2025","Because the nimble, genre-hopping movie is set in the world of K-pop, it may not even occur to fans that they‚Äôre watching a musical -- although it‚Äôs kind of hard to deny as you catch yourself singing along.",Fresh
Top Critic,Brandon Yu,"Jun 23, 2025","The movie is funniest when it pokes at pop culture that is highly manufactured, from K-pop to K-dramas to mass-produced singing competitions ‚Äî the very things the film itself would never stoop to.",Fresh
Top Critic,Matt Goldberg,"Jun 23, 2025","Thankfully, no one needs to be a K-pop expert to appreciate the film, and while its plotting is fairly thin, the movie relishes the outsized emotions of its characters and world without ever veering into outright parody.",Fresh
Audience,,"Aug 27, 2025","It was good story line wise,and the animation was a 10/10 and I especially enjoyed the music and the soundtrack but would recommend for anyone who is a musician and a fan of anime and animation like myself

Audience,,"Aug 27, 2025","This movie is perfection across so many theme's genre's and motifs. From the colors to symbolisms, the movie is amelioration that this era of movies needed.

Audience,,"Aug 27, 2025","Put this movie off for a few months until i remembered it existed. Classic and plain tropes that successfully generate into a beautiful message and story. ON TOP of the top quality animation and catchy songs, Sony Animation continues to reign the animation industry.",4/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 27, 2025","Fantastic Four was great, Superman was a complete knockout that singlehandedly will invigorate the DCU brand for years.. but KPop Demon Hunters is, despite it's kitschy-cringe name, absolute the movie of the summer--if not the year and maybe more. The fact that the original songs from the soundtrack attributed to fictional KPop acts have completely dominated the charts for weeks now, and that a super limited one-weekend theater run where the explicit goal was to have people who have ALREADY SEEN THE FILM MANY TIMES to shell out close to $20 a ticket each to see this movie on the big screen and turn their theaters into little concert venues, full-throatedly belting out the songs and laughing and crying in their seats.  These are a testament to the movie's staying power and I for one hope this trend continues into the future. 

There's not enough I could say about this movie. It's hilarious, heavy, touching, and cathartic. It being a love-letter to all things Korean is core to the DNA of the film and yet it's also a beautiful cherry on top. This film, along with Netflix's Squid Games s1-3 have been contributing to a massive surge in interest of Korean culture and I couldn't be more here for it. I hope it spawns some more movies and that the creators and talent involved in this production are the ones given free reign to create the next one, whatever it is!

10000/10 time to go watch it again",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 27, 2025","Soulless, parasocial",0.5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 27, 2025","Me encant√≥, fue divertido y entretenido la pel√≠cula.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 26, 2025","Too little too overrated, I think it was a bit more buzz than fuzz, but the songs are great (obviously Golden is a worldwide phenomena for a reason) nice message, the moral lesson of truth embracing oneself and stop pretending to please is very well adapted for current generation",4/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 26, 2025",The most absolute funniest show on Netflix that I know. I hope they make a Kpop demon hunters 2. Pleeeeeeaaaase I'm begging the creator to create Kpop demon hunters 2. But it is amazingüëè .,5/5.0

Audience,Katie,"Aug 26, 2025",The first time I watched with my daughter I was hooked.  Seeing it in the theater had to have been our 4th or 5th time watching.  The crowd was electric and the big screen made the animation even better.,5/5.0

Audience,CJ,"Aug 26, 2025","It's been quite some time since I've seen something so unique, where you can truly feel the love and passion in every frame of animation. The music is incredible, and it even has a few extra levels of humor for folks who are familiar with Kpop culture as a whole.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 26, 2025",Great Movie but the plot felt like it was cut short at the end.,4.5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 26, 2025","Kpop Demon Hunters is currently the fourth most-watched film on Netflix ever, so I decided to give this a chance despite knowing practically nothing about K-Pop. To my surprise, Kpop Demon Hunters is an impressive film with vibrant, energetic animation and a charming soundtrack. While I am oblivious to the Korean cultural elements of Kpop Demon Hunters, I can definitely appreciate this film for its ambitiousness and stylish artistic creativity. 

In all honesty, I found the film to be overly childish at times, but Kpop Demon Hunters is undoubtedly a children‚Äôs film meant for children (so it‚Äôs hard to critique something for which I am clearly not the target audience). However, I did enjoy the playfulness of the story and the blend of song and music into the film. Kpop Demon Hunters does feel overly cluttered at times, but it could also very well be that I am unfamiliar with the cultural aspects of the film. Regardless, I had a rather good time with Kpop Demon Hunters and I was certainly never bored. 

Overall, Kpop Demon Hunters is proof that any story can thrive through animation as a medium. The stylishness of Kpop Demon Hunters is commendable and the musical aspects are a standout. The songs are catchy, the animation is bright and colorful, and the voice cast is immensely talented.",3/5.0

Audience,Parker,"Aug 26, 2025","I love this movie and I was super glad to get the chance to see it in theaters. The energy in the theater was really amazing and a lot of people did little things to resemble characters like doing their hair, except one person fully dressed up as mystery and it made me really happy to see",5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 25, 2025","I can't say enough good about this movie. It's been a long time since I've seen a film that made me say ""Well, this is going to be my new personality from now on"", and KPop Demon Hunters did just that.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 25, 2025","This has became a new comfort movie for me. I'll be honest I now listen to the movies soundtrack because I don't know how but along with the stellar animation style of ""Spider-Man Into/Across the Spiderverse"" (like seriously Sony Pictures keep it up, you're no.1) it also has a near perfect catchy soundtrack where everything doesn't feel like an overplayed pop song (like with whatever Disney and everyone else is doing now). Not only that but it takes some ballsy creative decisions but also hits the mark on EVERY SINGLE ONE. The romance is great and really has fun while not being obvious with it. The movie has an amazing message too. I would even go so far as to say this movie... is a modern masterpiece.",5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 25, 2025","The humor definitely is written catering to millennials like as if we were watching a cooler version genre of Shrek while leaning on a more modern and popular theme in kpop. That dry/sarcastic sense of humor proves its best while not being overly cringy. This movie could‚Äôve came out anywhere between 2000-2013 and would‚Äôve been just as popular. It‚Äôs a sad reflection of today‚Äôs generation‚Äôs lack of creativity & storytelling.   

Why not combine popular movie genres together like action, music and comedy? It almost felt like a blend of The Avengers meet a musical..it just works so well.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 25, 2025",Really great sony film that was very awesome to see i wasn't expecting it to be that great I haven't seen no trailers or anything even though its sony. I wanted to surprise myself and great 10/10 film,5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 25, 2025","I never, ever, ever review online. But this film was SO good that I signed up just to. I‚Äôve got 2 kids, 10 year old daughter and 7 year old son. My daughter is well into Japan / Korea etc and this was expected for her to love. My son loves Pokemon so this was an unexpected twist that he is obsessed. The music is phenomenal - every big track is out of this world. I went into it with no expectations and came out sobbing at ‚Äòthis is what is sounds like‚Äô. The female representation is wicked. Munching, sarcasm, ugly crying, friendship, neurodivergency, strength, rage ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs perfect. The visuals are amazing. If I could rate it 10 starts I would. I beg there‚Äôs a number 2.",5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 25, 2025","This movie is better than it has any right to be. Easy recommendation if you have Netflix. Would be worth signing up for a month to give it a watch. Great animation, surprisingly strong, relatable, and deals with mature topics, but like all the best Pixar movies, it‚Äôll have themes that resonate with adults and children. Almost published this without talking about the music.. incredible talent.. listen I‚Äôm not a KPOP guy‚Ä¶ this soundtrack is sitting comfortably in my library.  This movie is worth every second of your time.

Audience,,"Aug 24, 2025","Directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans deliver a masterpiece of great songs and a even greater time in this better than expected film. Y‚Äôall better believe the hype that been surrounding this film for a few months it‚Äôs so much fun and charming and continuing to prove why Sony Pictures Animation is becoming an incredible studio and Netflix has a real true must see movie on its platform. The voice performances from both the regular and vocal actors are amazing throughout the whole film with those of Arden Cho, Ahn Hyo-seop and the singing performance of Ejae being the real standouts of the movie! The songs are amazing, sound great, incredible catchy and well written and had people all throughout my sing along version I was in singing throughout and will definitely be listening to them for a while. The animation is masterful and feels like both of the Spider Verse film in all the best ways and I love how it seamlessly combines elements of 3D computer animation and anime style animation so effortlessly. It‚Äôs the easiest recommendation I‚Äôve had in a while and an absolute must see for everyone!",5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 24, 2025","Kpop Demon Hunter is a dazzling blend of action, laughter, and music that manages to captivate audiences of all ages.  The film‚Äôs colorful energy, heartfelt moments, and creative storytelling make it irresistible for kids, while the humor and sleek production keep adults equally hooked. Most impressive of all is the soundtrack, a dazzling mix of beats and melodies that feels instantly addictive. It‚Äôs no surprise fans report playing these songs on repeat again and again.  Kpop Demon Hunter is more than just a movie, it‚Äôs an all-around experience that leaves you wanting to hit the replay button immediately.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 24, 2025","I went in knowing nothing.  Parts of it moved well and I enjoyed, but then it quickly became apparent that while I thought this was a story about 3 female demon hunters, it was about 1 of them and a demon.  The love story kept taking me out of the stories that seemed far more interesting. 
I felt like I went to watch a Disney movie when I had thought I was going to see something else.  
That is not the film's fault, I went in knowing nothing and thinking something that it wasn't.
In the end, while I could find enjoyment at times, I felt like the movie dragged on for a lot of it.  
There is a fandom out there for it, and I love that this is there for them.  
I am just not one of that fandom.",3/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 24, 2025","The best animated movie I have seen in a while. A few reasons why is that the animation always was great, the songs are breaking records, and the whole movie itself.

I NEVER pay to watch a movie in theaters after watching it for ""Free"" but my son loved it (he watched it at least 3 times) I really wanted to hear the music in theaters, so when I found it was coming to theaters for this weekend, I was the one that kept looking for the tickets to go on sale (and my wife bought us all shirts...).  It was worth seeing in theaters! PS: Seeing this made me re-watch the 2 spider-verse movies.  I even VPNed to Canada to watch the first one.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 24, 2025","K-Pop Demon Hunters: A Sing-Along Event (2025)

This was fun. I was able to catch this in theaters during the limited two-day Sing-Along Event, and I‚Äôm glad I did.

The atmosphere was electric‚Äîlots of positive vibes and excitement. The auditorium would come alive with singing, and at times the audience even quoted lines from the movie in unison. That kind of communal energy was just fun to be part of.

Whoever came up with this idea at Netflix and Sony Pictures Animation made a brilliant move. I‚Äôd already enjoyed this at home on Netflix, but watching it on the big screen with a crowd was a whole different experience. It‚Äôs a great reminder of how special the theatrical experience can be. This is a true testament to the magic of the cinematic experience‚Äîsharing a movie on the big screen with an audience.

The movie itself really shines on the big screen. The animation is awesome, the story is cool and unique, the characters are fun and enjoyable, the humor lands throughout, and the music is as catchy as ever.

If you‚Äôre interested, it‚Äôs definitely worth catching on the big screen on its last day.",4/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 24, 2025","One Of The Best Animated Films Of The 2020's

The Animation Is Of A Similar Style To & On The Same Level As Spiderverse & Mutant Mayhem. The Music Is Phenomenal & Catchy. The Choreography For Both The Musical Performances & The Fights With The Demons Are Absolutely Solid.

The Themes Of Shame & Acceptance Are Perfectly Catpured Through Metaphors & Brialliant Story Telling. The Voice Acting Is Top Notch & Emotional Elements Hit Hard. It Leaves Me Wanting To Watch It Over And Over.

Audience,,"Aug 24, 2025","How did Sony not see this making money when they made their contract with Netflix? Seriously, just, HOW?! Okay, I am going to go through all of this to explain what worked and the few flaws it does have. (don‚Äôt look at me like that, every movie/show has them.) 
First is the animation style. Like Spider Verse it‚Äôs full CG but with jittery low frame rate that mimic stop motion. 100% honest here, I hate this style with a passion, that‚Äôs the reason it took me so long to watch this. The whole point of CG is to animate faster with more fluid movements than hand drawn. Doing movies in this style defeats the purpose and makes the whole thing look like it hasn‚Äôt rendered properly, annoying the heck out of me. That‚Äôs just a personal pet peeve of mine so I won‚Äôt let it effect my review of the movie. 
The art style itself is great for the story. Not too realistic but cartoonish enough to show the strong range of expressions the characters posses. Sometimes it does go a bit far, corn cob eyes and bean mouths come to mind, but these moments are rare enough that I can look past it. The characters themselves are the perfect balance of simple design but complex personality. They even drop the trope of keeping characters in the same costume and have the girls constantly change outfits, even their makeup changes. I will be very surprised if there aren‚Äôt any kids dressed as characters from this movie for Halloween. The only character design I have an issue with is the villain Gwi-Ma. He‚Äôs a giant neon pink fiery fart cloud and that‚Äôs it. His minions at least eat souls with claws and fangs making them more intimidating, but all I can see Gwi-Ma doing is burning your marshmallows while laughing maniacally. There was an idea that was cut out of him appearing as a giant demon at the final concert but this was scrapped for some reason. 
The plot does sound unusual at first but it‚Äôs unique enough to make even skeptics give it a look if done right, which, thankfully, it was. The story is told very well but does have a point or two that could have been done better. The biggest one is their mentor Celine. She doesn‚Äôt need to be in the movie since her part is so small it‚Äôs almost non existent. Her only purpose is for backstory and that‚Äôs taken care of in the intro and a short flashback. Her scene towards the end could have been cut and the story would go on as usual. Another idea that was cut was for Celine to have killed Rumi‚Äôs parents, her mother for being a traitor and her father for being a demon, but this would have been better if they kept it in. Not only would Celine have more significance to making Rumi act the way she does but her character would have made for an unintentional background villain in the girls story. The bird and the cat were made just to have animal plushie sales, they have no other purpose but I get it. Every kid flick needs a cute animal companion character. 
The voices and music are what sell the whole thing. The VA‚Äôs do a wonderful job bringing the characters to life and the songs‚Ä¶.what can I even say? The music slams, and this is coming from someone who hates anything that sounds like rap music but even I love the opening song. We get to see the difference in both groups styles perfectly. Huntr/x songs come from the heart with emotional lyrics while Saja Boys are generic boy band songs. Both catchy but only one has heart.
I did get left with a lot of questions. How were they chosen to become hunters? What happened to the half of the plane they abandoned at the start of the movie? Why were people physically disappearing after their souls were taken? Do people like those in the bath house see a group of Kpop girls running around swinging at nothing since they apparently can‚Äôt see the demons? Questions we don‚Äôt get answered but the movie still works. I would have gladly sat through another 30 ‚Äì 45 minutes of story if it fixed the few issues the movie had but even without the fixes, it‚Äôs still a fun movie with a fantastic soundtrack. Take notes Disney! Maybe you can learn something!!!!",4.5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 23, 2025","THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!! It‚Äôs so bad that it became one of my sacred movies. Like WHY is it so addicting? I LITERALLY WATCHED IT LIKE 60 TIMES OR SOMETHING?? That‚Äôs a bad sign, right?? Well‚Ä¶ yes and no. Let‚Äôs cut the joke‚Äîit‚Äôs a clich√© one anyway.

The movie truly gave me an extraordinary feeling, the kind of feeling that I, and maybe millions of others, always long for. The feeling of letting go of all the embarrassing, shameful, and heavy things that anchor us down, keeping us stuck in one place, and making us believe we can‚Äôt reach what we yearn for. Kpop Demon Hunters (KDH) told us to keep fighting despite our flaws and to keep believing that we will all reach the ‚ÄúGolden‚Äù point at some moment in our lives.

I used to come to RT just to criticize movies, but this time I only came here to appreciate everyone who worked on this film. Thank you so much for this masterpiece. Also, a huge thanks to the music production teams‚Äîthe lyricists, composers, singers! The three amazing humans with absolutely golden voices: EJAE, Rei Ami, and Audrey Nuna! You‚Äôre all incredible!

Sorry if this review sounds more like something I‚Äôd tell a psychiatrist. But I guess that‚Äôs how you know a movie is truly impactful and incredible.

This movie came out of nowhere‚Äîsuddenly appearing on my screen on a random day. At first, I ridiculed it for its name (and yes, it‚Äôs still a silly title even now). But‚Ä¶ this won‚Äôt affect its score. It‚Äôs rare for me to give a movie 5/5 stars, so I consider this a kind of sacred award. Massive congratulations to this film.

I honestly expect both Academy and Grammy recognition for this movie.

And Sony, this is your loss for not releasing it on the big screen.

For everyone still doubting this film: please, you need to watch it at least once in your lifetime. There are so many other things I haven‚Äôt even mentioned that are just as incredible. I truly believe you‚Äôll like it, no matter your age or level of maturity.",5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 23, 2025","In my opinion: It's good, but not great (coming from someone who's rewatched this movie multiple times.) 
I feel like the movie should've either A. Been longer, or B. been a series, as it feels like a LOT of characters were underdeveloped and didn't have enough time to be fleshed out. Rumi and Jinu feel like the only characters to actually get development while everyone else is shoved to the side, and in general the plot feels like it could've been more, that the MOVIE could've been more.
That said, there are a lot of good things about this movie, and I totally understand why people love it. The animation is stellar, obviously, I like how they just let the main 3 Huntr/x girls be themselves without focusing on making them too ""ugly"" or ""weird,"" the music is great, Derpy and the bird are really adorable, I liked Rumi and Jinu's dynamic, and all around the movie isn't bad by any means. I just feel like there could've been so much more they could've done with it, and like I said I wish it was longer or a 2D animated series. But honestly, if you love this movie, I completely get why and hopefully I'll like the upcoming 2 sequels planned more.",3/5.0

Voice acting that was performed extremely well that you could tell that they had put their hearts into this project.

Wow, this movie's good. I never planned on watching this movie. I am not a KPop or anime-like-animation person AT ALL. But I wanted to see what all the hype is about. Is it really that good? Yes, yes it is. Holy carp, the animation had no right being as good as it is. If you show the first scene of them eating on the plane, talking to their fans, then fighting demons to anyone who likes animation, they will immediately drop everything they're doing and go watch this movie. If you didn't like anything about this movie other than the animation, I bet you'd still give it a 3/5. I could sing the animation's praises til the day I die. The music is sooooo good as well. Each singer in this movie has the most amazing voice ever, and they hit their notes perfectly every time (except for Rumi, of course, but that's on purpose). This movie does not waste time with boring exposition. They give you like one or two small flashbacks, and you're able to fill everything else in yourself.

Overall, the plot is great, the animation is AMAZING, this singing is golden (pun intended), and there's a great message to be learned. This movie deserves to be talked about in the same breath as Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Spider-Verse, and Mitchells vs. The Machines. KPop Demon Hunters absolutely deserves to be seen in theaters, and it brings me joy to see that most of the showings are selling out.

The plot is straightforward, which is definitely not a bad thing in itself, but it's so utterly predictable and strangely clich√©? For someone who was baited by the sheer hype this movie got, I genuinely believed reviewers who called this story 'subversive'. There is absolutely nothing unique about Kpop Demon Hunters.

(SPOILERS WARNING HERE ON OUT)

Rumi herself is a half demon, which is revealed in pretty much the first ten minutes of the movie. While I was watching it, I tried to ignore the immediate ick it gave me as I found it very reminiscent of a gacha club video, thinking the plot was going to progress in a way that wasn't cringe. 

That didn't happen, of course; Huntrix encounters a boy group that turns out to be demons trying to draw attention away from Huntrix to unleash the apocalypse or whatever, and the most normal-looking and conventionally handsome member of the Saja Boys, Jinu, takes an interest in Rumi. Why wouldn't he? They were both fated to forbidden love from the get-go. He has a sad backstory, the leads feel an emotional connection when they meet up for their secret rendezvous, they fall in love, he betrays her and then dies for her in the end in the most predictable way you can think of. (There's definitely going to be a second movie, and Jinu is ABSOLUTELY going to come back alive. I already predicted it because that's how this crap always goes.) They have ZERO chemistry too- say what you want to say about shipping them, but they were one of the most bland vanilla-scented white bread-esque couples I had ever witnessed.

The side characters are very flat. I thought Mira was going to get more development because the movie opens with her screentime and she's kind of cool, or at least cooler than the Y/N slot we call the main character. Imagine my utter disappointment when I realised her character gets no exploration through the entire movie when the ending credits played. Mira and Zoe are one unit because Rumi absolutely has to be as centred as possible. They're her sidekicks, so why wouldn't they just be her supporters? And neither of them actually have love interests either. 

The dialogue is horrible. I mean, it's a kid's movie, and dialogue is meant to be disgustingly digestible, but that won't stop me from criticising it anyway. Absolutely horrible. So utterly cringe and painful to listen to. The songs are also average at best. I hate them but I guess they sound like kpop songs so I'll try to be fair. They're not catchy- fans only think they are because the media hypes them up so much that the songs are EVERYWHERE and it sort of drills into your brain after a while. When I first watched the movie I forgot how the songs sounded but because I found them all over my FYP I was forced to listen to it over and over again.

I could definitely go on about everything I loathe about this movie, but I'll stop there and talk about why it's still a 5/10 at the end of the day. The animation is great, I like the ugly facial expressions the female characters make that are quite rare, the action scenes are spectacular, and I feel that this movie still has potential. Most of the bad things I pointed out are very much possible to correct in the second movie, such as side character development and a more nuanced plot, so I'll probably be there to watch the second movie as well.",0.5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 19, 2025","TLDR: Its a great family friendly kids/teens musical. More mature than Descendants but nothing too crazy. Its a fun comfy watch, but doesn't reinvent the wheel.

This movie is as a whole, pretty great. There's nothing really to give major criticism to, but I'm very critical of animated movies since I really enjoy them. The music is really pretty good, I'd take Golden or Soda Pop over Let it Go any day.

My Nitpicks:
This movie would have been SO much better 2D animated. It tries so hard to be 'Anime' and just comes across as a pale imitation. The Art style unfortunately treads into ""grubhub commercial"" animation like 'Turning Red', but when the art direction gets to be itself instead of trying to be anime or disney, it really has some gorgeous scenes. The entire finale is a really gorgeous eye candy, especially for CG animation. But any time they tried to do the ""silly anime faces"" it came across as ugly instead of funny.
A small nitpick is that the girls really lack an evolution of their visual style, never take down their hair even when in pajamas or the bath, never really visually evolve. We're very much told they've changed but in the artistic direction they're the same as the movie started. Theres a lot of stuff thats just told to the audience instead of shown, or shown with narration. I know its a kids movie but it could have used more of the character evolution shown on screen rather than told.

The plot is simple yet solid, there are some things I'm confused about especially as the movie adds to the world's lore, particularly around the act of ""Sealing the Honmoon"" and how impactful that event is. In later scenes its treated like the final battle against the demons and Rumi's only hope for normalcy, but its also implied they seal it every year and it holds long enough for the girls to get a little break. 

As a whole, its a fun movie, but take the hype with a grain of salt before you go in.",3.5/5.0

As someone who doesn‚Äôt listen to kpop in any way shape or form, I enjoyed the music in this movie a lot. The artstyle was also phenomenal. It managed to capture the appeal of the animation from the spider-verse movies, but it set itself apart from those movies with its own artistic direction.

Arden Cho and the rest of the voice cast do amazing jobs bringing the characters to life. The main character, Rumi, is on a journey of self-discovery, and it‚Äôs really heartwarming to see how much they grow and learn.

But this is an absolute masterpiece, with depth in meaning, great score, awesome visuals and impeccable references to korean culture, I was glued to the screen the whole time and I didn't even see time pass while watching it. Absolutely amazing.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025",Amazing I came into it thinking it would suck and came out liking it the songs were fire the story was good,5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","This movie teaches self-confidence, humbleness, and love. Love wins all.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","KPop Demon Hunters is a riot, featuring colourful and action-filled animation, even if its dialogue, characterization, and musical lyricism feel trite, typical of many modern children's films.",3.5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","KPop Demon Hunters gives off some very good (and catchy) vibes. As a 15 year old, I thought I wouldn't be the target audience, yet I found myself bopping along to the songs and having a good time. Wouldn't say it's worth all the hype but is definitely worth a watch.",3.5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","I literally recommend this to everyone I meet. The action is fast paced. The songs are all bangers- literally not a flop in the entire soundtrack, which is rare for me. The story is unique and it resonates so much with me. The animation is amazing. I can't even think of a character I hate. Super amazing movie",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","As a grown man with a daughter, this movie slaps! It keeps your attention, makes you sing catchy songs and has cool characters. The songs are so good that golden is number 2 on the billboard 100. Absolute much watch, my daughter watches it everyday!",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","I say just one word ""AMAZING""!!! 
A plot really intense with an incredible animation!!! I watched it 5 times!!

ABSOLUTE MUST-SEE!!",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","(2 boys; 10 and 4)  This was a pretty solid movie.  I'm glad I heard about it via word of mouth, because based on the title, I never would have watched this having two boys.  But they both thoroughly enjoyed it, and my 4 year old was singing the songs by the end of hearing them for the first time. My 10 year old also liked the songs and was invested in the story.  As for the parent; this is exactly what you want from a kids movie; good storytelling, and good enough jokes where you should be entertained along with the kids. A great family movie that doesn't skimp on story because it's a ""kids"" movie (I hate that people think kids movies should be dumb. Or children deserve well-crafted stories too).",4.5/5.0
Audience,Veronica,"Aug 13, 2025",It is a MUST see and i genuinely don‚Äôt know a single person who has seen this movie and has not liked it. The music is fabulous and everything abt the dialogue just hits so deep. You just have to get past the name to actually understand what the movie is about and the meaning behind.,5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025",i mean it's okay but to me felt really random. in my opinion the plot was good but it had okay execution. it felt funny at sometimes but personally i didnt really enjoy the songs.,3/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 13, 2025","All'inizio pensavo che fosse un prodotto da nulla ma quando l'ho visto mi sono completamente sbagliato, l'animazione √® perfetta, le protagoniste sono perfette come anche gli altri personaggi e gli effetti speciali sono micidiali, questo film deve essere candidato agli Oscar",5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 12, 2025","Amazing. The characters, the plot, the visuals. Beautiful. It made you feel all the feels. A fun ride. Highly recommend.",5/5.0
Audience,,"Aug 12, 2025","The title gives you the basic plot, to say anything else would completely give it away...so let's do so in a very convoluted way! 
Sailor Moon meets Totally Spies meets The Powerpuff Girls (Z?) with styling reminiscent of Kubo and the Two Strings, Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, Namona, and Puss In Boots: the Last Wish.
As long as you like music, it's kind of irrelevant whether you like Kpop specifically.",5/5.0

Audience,Anastasia,"Aug 10, 2025",This movie was amazing. It gives you a deep look at different cultures and offers a unique perspective on mental health. While the younger kids like the songs and animation older kids would get a message to not be afraid of their scars and find that they dont need to hide them. I love this message and the hope it gives younger generations.,5/5.0

Audience,,"Aug 10, 2025","I watched this movie with my friends, who were way more involved in it than I was. This type of movie isn‚Äôt really my kind of film, especially one that involves a plot and characters that I‚Äôm indifferent towards and don‚Äôt care about. However, I will acknowledge that the animation is very impressive and it was cool to look at! I could tell the production team worked very hard on the details!",2.5/5.0
